<h3>Personal Portfolio Website!</h3>
<h6> I have made this personal portfolio website as a part of my "Small Project Folder". I've used HTML, CSS and no use of Javascript.
This is a full responsive website shows the certificates, work and projects I have done so far. This was my first ever project I picked up after learning basics of the Web development.
